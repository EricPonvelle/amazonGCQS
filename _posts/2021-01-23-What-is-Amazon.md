## Amazon's Humble Origins

When Jeff Bezos began Amazon in 1994, he started out of a garage, selling books. Today, Amazon is a multi-national billion-dollar online retailer of more than 12 million products from manufacturers and second-hand markets. Sourced from global *and* local markets, Amazon can provide myriad goods and products for customers anywhere. For more information on the Amazon company, see the **About Us** page on the [**Amazon website**](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us){:target="_blank"}.

## Anazon Gift Card

Amazon accepts all major forms of payment such as credit card, debit, and other methods of payment. For more information, see **the Accepted Payments** page on the [**Amazon Help Site**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A){:target="_blank"}.

Amazon Gift cards function as a temporary method of payment. Users either purchase or receive an Amazon Gift Card for a set value, such as $25, that allows them to purchase almost anything from the Amazon Web Store. Some restrictions do apply. For more information, see the **Considerations and Restrictions** section.
