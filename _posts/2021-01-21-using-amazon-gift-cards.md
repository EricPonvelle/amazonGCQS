If you purchased or received an Amazon Gift Card, either as a digital code or a physical card, the method for redemption is the same.

## Redeeming an Amazon Gift Card

With an Amazon eGift Card or physical Gift Card ready, navigate to the [**Redeem a gift card**](https://www.amazon.com/gc/redeem/ref=gc_redeem_new_exp_DesktopRedirect){:target="_blank"} page on the Amazon website.

In the "Enter claim code" field, enter your code. On physical cards, there may be a strip of covering tape that must be removed to see the gift card code. Once entered, select "Apply to your balance." Your "Current Gift Card Balance" will update with the card's value.


## Using the Amazon Gift Card Balance

Once applied to an account, the Amazon Gift Card credit can be applied to nearly any purchases. At checkout, select the 'Change' button next to the "Choose a payment method" section. Under "Your available balance" section, check the box to use some of the gift card balance to pay for the purchase.

Confirm this option with the "Use this payment method" button, then review your purchase. Since the gift card balance is applied before placing the order, the balance will be $0. Select "Place your order" to complete your transaction.
