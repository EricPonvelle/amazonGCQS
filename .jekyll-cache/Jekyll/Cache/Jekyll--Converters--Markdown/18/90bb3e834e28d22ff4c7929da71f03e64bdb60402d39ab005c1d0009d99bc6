I"ğ<p>If you purchased or received an Amazon Gift Card, either as a digital code or a physical card, the method for redemption is the same.</p>

<h2 id="redeeming-an-amazon-gift-card">Redeeming an Amazon Gift Card</h2>

<p>With an Amazon eGift Card or physical Gift Card ready, navigate to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gc/redeem/ref=gc_redeem_new_exp_DesktopRedirect" target="_blank"><strong>Redeem a gift card</strong></a> page on the Amazon website.</p>

<p>In the â€œEnter claim codeâ€ field, enter your code. On physical cards, there may be a strip of covering tape that must be removed to see the gift card code. Once entered, select â€œApply to your balance.â€ Your â€œCurrent Gift Card Balanceâ€ will update with the cardâ€™s value.</p>

<p>Once applied to an account, the Amazon Gift Card credit can be applied to nearly any purchases. At checkout, select the â€˜Changeâ€™ button next to the â€œChoose a payment methodâ€ section. Under â€œYour available balanceâ€ section, check the box to use some of the gift card balance to pay for the purchase.</p>

<p>Confirm this option with the â€œUse this payment methodâ€ button, then review your purchase. Since the gift card balance is applied before placing the order, the balance will be $0. Select â€œPlace your orderâ€ to complete your transaction.</p>
